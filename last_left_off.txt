Spomething about having a different port other than Port: 5500 is not displaying the items in the carts. I think i tmay have to do with using different servers and localstorage

you might want to ask how ot get the server to open under whatever port/server/html i use on my local machine instead of the cercel.app port/server..... for instance: this is my local server: http://127.0.0.1:5500/Checkout_Pages/shoppingCart.html
