issues:

5. fix the "Free returns" and "free shipping" by the products 
6. the only value is subtotal, there is no total in the summary, nor is there any taxes. should i add a tax?
7. why am i getting "nan" in the product pages "quantity" section?
8. when adding some of the products to the cart, the prices aren't accurate. for example, clicking row C "choice" add-on-icons do not match the prices in locastorge
9. the product titles in the shoppingCart also need to direc tuser to product pages bsaed on their deals or non-deal prices (use the shoppingCart code as it basically is working for that page)
10. the "no items page" needs the "added!" effect for the add-ons
