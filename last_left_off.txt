I know why the image is not showing up when running the vercel app in shoppingcart for aliexpress-clone. It is because the ImgData key, for instance, is http://127.0.0.1:5500/resources/images/makeup-img-two.jpg.

If I put a random image url from a website it'll show on the shopping cart.

In other words, i need to figure out a way to change the imgData key so that the image key will run on vercel
